        Reactive forms use an explicit and immutable approach to
        managing the state of a form at a given point in time.
        Each change to the form state returns a new state, which
        maintains the integrity of the model between changes.
        Reactive forms are built around observable streams, where
        form inputs and values are provided as streams of input
        values, which can be accessed synchronously.

      <p class="go-body-copy">
        Reactive forms differ from template-driven forms in distinct
        ways. Reactive forms provide more predictability with
        synchronous access to the data model, immutability with
        observable operators, and change tracking through observable
        streams. If you prefer direct access to modify data in your
        template, template-driven forms are less explicit because they
        rely on directives embedded in the template, along with mutable
        data to track changes asynchronously.
